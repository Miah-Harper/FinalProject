    My shop, City Bones, is a combination of macrame, and jewelry with animal bones incorporated.
    <br />
    All bones are responsibly sourced and cleaned by me.
    <br />
    When I was a kid I started having my version of a burial service for any deceased animals I had found.
    <br />
    I did this as a way to honor the life they had and in my little child brain I felt I was showing
    <br />
    them that I loved and cared for them. Over the years I started incorporating them into my art as a
    <br />way to appreciate  and honor them in a new way. And now I want others to appreciate their beauty as much as I do!

 <p style="font-family:monospace; text-align:center; font-size: small">  With the nature of my work, each skull, vertebrates and other bones will have slight variations in color,
    <br />shapes and sizes from what’s pictured.
    <br />I take a lot of pride in my work and will not sell anything I feel are in poor condition.
    <br />My pieces can also be quite delicate, so please be careful!
    <br />I am not reliable for any damages after purchase.</p>
